#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)O(n) linear

b)O(n^2) because it has two loops

c) O(n) linear

## Exercise II

start at the bottom floor and drop the egg over and over until it breaks, every floor above that floor the egg will break

write a recursive funtion that checks if the egg breaks
base case of if n <= 0 return 1
if the egg doesn't break +1 to floors

runtime of this should be O(n)
