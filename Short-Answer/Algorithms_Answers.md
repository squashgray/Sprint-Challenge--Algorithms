#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)O(n) the input is being run at a constant rate which makes it linear

b)O(n^2) because it has two loops, makes it quadratic

c)O(n) the input is being run at a constant rate which makes it linear

## Exercise II

start at the bottom floor and drop the egg over and over until it breaks, every floor above that floor the egg will break

write a recursive funtion or a while loop that checks if the egg breaks
base case of if n <= 0 return 1
if the egg doesn't break +1 to floors

runtime of this should be O(n) as its linear
